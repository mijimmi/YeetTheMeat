# YeetTheMeat

YeetTheMeat is a fast-paced eatery simulator where you run an ordinary eatery except its... **extremely slippery**?! Yes, you read that right! You will prepare, cook, and serve delicious and mouth-watering Filipino dishes to your beloved customers by utilizing your acquired sliding techniques. After all, you are a master in the quirky hobby of sliding unlike those normie gloving bros. Not only do you have to prepare, cook, and serve to your customers, but you also need to ensure that you give your customers the best of the best customer service. That means no hitting customers, otherwise they will leave a negative review of your eatery and wish eternal misfortune to your eatery, which you don't want obviously. What's even better is that **you can tag someone along with you** in running your eatery. It could be your very best friend, your romantic partner, your instructor, or literally anyone. After all, two is better than one. So what are you waiting for? Grab yourself and your buddy and run the eatery of your dreams!

YeetTheMeat is the submission of Culay Games for the Game Jam 2026 hosted by UPCSG.

## Theme Integration

The theme of the game jam, which is "The Path Less Taken", is primarily interpreted as something that involves **optimization**. We think that "the path less taken" is all about taking the shortest path, but we interpreted this conceptually. This "path less taken" then becomes performing the most optimal actions to reach your end goal. This is manifested in these aspects in YeetTheMeat:
1. **Achieving the highest possible rating in the given time limit.** YeetTheMeat's main objective is ultimately an optimization problem, that is: _how can I achieve the highest possible rating of my eatery in the allotted span of time?_
2. **Determining the most optimal way of navigating around the map.**
3. **Getting assistance from another player using the coop system.** YeetTheMeat's two-player cooperative mode support allows players to get help from another player. This allows both players in maximizing their eatery's rating much easier as to only doing it alone. Furthermore, it also maximizes the fun in playing YeetTheMeat since playing with someone is always more fun than playing alone, well unless you hate the person you're playing with. It can be said that YeetTheMeat's coop system maximizes the players' performance and enjoyment.
